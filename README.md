# Osu Neural Network Created Using Pytorch

- DISCLAIMER : I am not responsible for any consequences that stem from the illicit use of the contents of this repository.

## Info

- Data extracted from replays produced by a slightly modified version of [danser-go](https://github.com/Wieku/danser-go)

- Aiming works but clicking does not.

- All skins used are located in [assets/skins](assets/skins)

- Showcase videos [Clicking (DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgHyN98iR1M&t=5s) and [Aiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEoSrtow8Qw).

## Quick Start
- The following assume that your monitor/screen size is 1920x1080 (plan to make it dynamic later)
- [This video will show you how to create a clone the repo's, create a dataset, and train a model]()

## Example Autopilot play below on [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765778#osu/1627148). The model was trained using [this map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1721048#osu/3560542).
